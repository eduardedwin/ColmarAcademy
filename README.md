# ColmarAcademy

This website is the final project in the Build Websites from Scratch course offered by Codecademy.

This is a mandatory requirement for every participant in order to complete the course and be certified by Codecademy.

This is not a real-life project and is intended to showcase the level of skills that I've gained ever since I joined the course in early September.

Thanks.
